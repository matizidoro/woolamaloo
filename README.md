## Getting Started

Hi there! This repository answers the Woolamaloo University test used to assess students knowledge for an internship at CMC.
Before running this project, you will need to have the steps below done.   

## Prerequisites

 - Having PyCharm or another IDE that runs Python 3.6 installed on your computer - any OS - is enough to run the script. Just clone this repository and run script.py through the IDE. However, if you use an Linux/Ubuntu based OS and want to run it from the terminal you can do the following:
 
    - Make sure that you have Python 3.6.x installed;
    - Install pip with the command:
    ```
      sudo apt install python3-pip
    ```
    - Now, you got to install virtualenv:
    ```
      sudo pip3 install virtualenv
    ```
    - Navigate to the repository project folder and active the environment running:
    ```  
      source venv/bin/activate
    ```
    - Then run script.py:
    ```  
      python3 script.py
    ```
